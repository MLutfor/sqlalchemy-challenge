# sqlalchemy-challenge
 
The SQL script for this programs IS based on the codes provided by the in-class assignments from the U of T Data Analysis bootcamp. 

ChaGPT was also used in the assistance of debugging and refactoring the script.

The following challenge uses Jupyter notebook and a web app to perfom sql queries on the climate for Hawaii.
Specifically, I'll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


Within the folder "Starter_Code", you'll find a "Resources" folder which contains the csv files and hawaii.sqlite for the analysis.
There is also the Hawaii_climate_Notebook for the Pandas and Matplotlib analysis, and the
Hawaii_climate_app for displaying the queries on a local website that'll be run on visual studio code.
